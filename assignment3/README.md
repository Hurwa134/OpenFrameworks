Create a new project which displays 4 active or inactive elements you might use in your story using basic shape primitives. These can be people, animals, trees, or any object you will need. Even if your story does not contain any characters with faces, one of the elements above should have a face (for now).

In setup() set your framerate to 60 fps

Show each drawing for 2 seconds in a slideshow using ofGetFrameNum and the c++ modulo operator

Include a static and animated screenshot in your .md for all projects from here on.
