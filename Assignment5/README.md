Project Conceptual Descriptions & Drawings

## Polygons and Sound

In this project, emotions change over 1 second and expressions are held for 1 second.
One primitive shape changes to a polygon, to represent the mouth of the face. The eyes are animated to show happiness and anger. The mouth shows expressions of surprise and anger. 

Starting at each change, the sound file of seagulls plays.
